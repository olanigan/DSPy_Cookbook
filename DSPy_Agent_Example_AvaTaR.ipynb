They asked for a summary in a clear format (one paragraph or two paragraphs). - **Negative Inputs:** The unsuccessful queries asked for the \"main contribution\" of the papers, which may not have been directly addressed in the summaries provided by the tool. The tool outputted general summaries instead of specific contributions. 2. **Computational Logic Review:** - The tool's logic appears to be functioning correctly, but it lacks the ability to extract specific information (like \"main contributions\") from the summaries it generates. It provides general summaries instead of targeted answers. 3. **Modification in Tools:** - To improve performance on negative inputs, consider implementing a more advanced natural language processing tool that can analyze the summary and extract specific information related to the user's query. This could involve using a tool that can perform question-answering based on the content of the paper rather than just summarizing it. Alternatively, a follow-up query could be designed to ask for specific sections of the paper that address contributions directly.\n",

This approach has proven successful in previous positive inputs, where clarity in the request led to satisfactory outputs.\n",

Compared with sentence-level topic structure, the paragraph-level topic structure can quickly grasp and understand the overall context of the document from a higher level, benefitting many downstream tasks such as summarization, discourse parsing, and information retrieval. However, the lack of large-scale, high-quality Chinese paragraph-level topic structure corpora restrained relative research and applications. To fill this gap, we build the Chinese paragraph-level topic representation, corpus, and benchmark in this paper. Firstly, we propose a hierarchical paragraph-level topic structure representation with three layers to guide the corpus construction. Then, we employ a two-stage man-machine collaborative annotation method to construct the largest Chinese Paragraph-level Topic Structure corpus (CPTS), achieving high quality. We also build several strong baselines, including ChatGPT, to validate the computability of CPTS on two fundamental tasks (topic segmentation and outline generation) and preliminarily verified its usefulness for the downstream task (discourse parsing).)\n",
